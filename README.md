crowdSort
=========

Contains the code from my "CrowdSort" software project


Class: TC 359, Server-Side web development
Technology: Groovy, Grails, MVC


    This was a software project I worked on for my TC 359 (Server Side Web Development) class at Michigan State University. The point of this project was to create an application of our choice.  Two other students and myself chose to come up with an application to put the Card Sorting process for web designers online and provide results by leveraging the power of the crowd.  Users can create an account and login.  Next, they create a project and define their top level categories and "cards" to be sorted.  Upon submission, the project is translated in to HITs on Amazon Mechanical Turk.  Once the HITs are completed by turkers the results are stored in our database.  The CrowdSort users are then able to login and view the results of their sort.  
    
    This MVC application was written in the Groovy programming language using the 'Grails' framework.  My role in our three person team was to do most of the work on the controller and views.  I also helped define the overall direction and architecture of the application.
